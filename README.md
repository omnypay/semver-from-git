# semver-from-git

Generates a new SEMVER based on existing SEMVER tags in the git repo its run in.


## Overview

Calculates and outputs a new SEMVER value based on existing SEMVER values.

* SEMVER must be in the form of `<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` I.E.: `0.1.0` 
  * or optionally based on the --prefix argument (in this example `--prefix v`)
    `<PREFIX><MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` I.E.: `v0.1.0`
* SEMVER `PATCH` is incremented by one if the current commit is one or more
  commits later than the last SEMVER git tag in the repo

By default the program outputs the new SEMVER to stdout and to the file `VERSION`
You can override the output filename/path by adding name to the command:

```
semver-from-git my-version-file
semver-from-git /somepath/my-version-file

```

If you don't want it to write to a file use the `-n` / `--no-file` flags

```
semver-from-git -n
```

### SEMVER Scenaries

#### No Previous SEMVER Tag

If there are no git tag in the form of a SEMVER, it will consider `0.0.0` as the
earlier SEMVER and will create a new SEMVER 0.0.1 as long as the current git
commit is later than the first commit.

#### Bump the Major or Minor numbers

Create a tag in the form of `RELEASE-<MAJOR>.<MINOR>`. For instance to make SEMVERs start from 0.1.0:

```
git tag RELEASE-0.1
git push origin refs/tags/RELEASE-0.1
```

The next SEMVER the program will produce will be `0.1.0`. Each one after that
will bump the `PATCH` (last number) by one until a new `RELEASE-m.n` is created.

#### Your SEMVER tags have a prefix

You may have a prefix in front of the SEMVER such as a `v`: `v0.1.0` If so run
the program with the `-p` or `--prefix` flag

```
semver-from-git -p v
```

Note that the results do NOT have the prefix. It is up to you to add a prefix when you make the tag such as:

```
NEWTAG=v`semver-from-git -p v`
```

## General Usage

```shell
$> semver-from-git -h
Generate a new semver based incremented from the last git tag that is a semver

Writes the result to stdout and to a file
The default output filename is VERSION

Usage: semver-from-git [filename]

Options:
  -p, --prefix PREFIX  Require a prefix before SEMVER
  -s, --sync           Do a git fetch --prune --tags first
  -n, --no-file        Only write to stdout. No output file
  -h, --help
```
